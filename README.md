# x32 Guide

Static site containing basic walkthroughs on how to do specific things on an X32/M32 audio console.

This project uses [vitepress](https://vitepress.dev/) to generate a static site with dynamic pieces using Vue and Vite.

This is a VERY new work in progress so stay tuned while I work on getting the groundwork laid!
