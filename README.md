# Audio Help

Static site containing basic walkthroughes on how to do specific things on various audio consoles. Currently only for
x32/M32 consoles with work started to expand.

This project uses [vitepress](https://vitepress.dev/) to generate a static site with dynamic pieces using Vue and Vite.

This is a VERY new work in progress so stay tuned while I work on getting the groundwork laid!
