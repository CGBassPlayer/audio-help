# Changing Channel Assignment

Let's say you are using Channels 1 and 2 through a stagebox and then your Aux 5 and 6 for some music and you want that all on 1 layer for easy access. The easiest thing to do would be to update the channel source for a pair of channels you are not using.


1. Select the channel you want your channel to be on.
2. On the screen, navigate to the `CONFIG` tab
3. On the bottom right, there is a `SOURCE` option
4. Turn the rotary encoder such that the source matches the input you want on that channel (so in the example above you would set that to Aux 5)
5. Repeat steps 1-4 on the next channel
